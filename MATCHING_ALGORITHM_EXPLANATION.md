# SPARC Matching Algorithm

## How It Works

### 1. **Basic Requirements Check**
- **Gender Compatibility**: Only matches men with women (fundamental requirement)
- **Age Preferences**: Respects age limits each person sets
- **Height Preferences**: Considers height requirements (typically men's preferences for women's height)

### 2. **Religious Compatibility (Most Important)**
These factors have the highest weight in our algorithm because religious alignment is crucial for Jewish marriages:

**Shabbat Observance** (Weight: 8/10)
- Fully Observant → Traditional → Spiritual → Non-observant
- People closer on this scale get higher compatibility scores

**Kosher Observance** (Weight: 8/10)  
- Strictly Kosher → Kosher at home → Flexible → Non-kosher
- Similar observance levels score higher

**Children's Jewish Education** (Weight: 7/10)
- Essential → Important → Valuable → Open to it → Not a priority
- Shared values about kids' education are critical

**Jewish Learning** (Weight: 6/10)
- Daily → Weekly → Occasionally → Rarely
- Similar commitment to learning scores better

### 3. **Family & Life Goals** (High Importance)
**Children Preferences** (Weight: 7/10)
- Want children vs. don't want children
- Have children and want more vs. don't want more
- Must align for relationship success

**Life Focus** (Weight: 6/10)
- Family-oriented vs. Career-driven vs. Self-fulfillment
- Similar life priorities create compatibility

### 4. **Cultural & Background Factors**
**Cultural Background** (Weight: 4/10)
- Ashkenazi, Sephardic (various origins), Mixed
- Shared cultural heritage often creates connection

**Languages** (Weight: 3/10)
- Hebrew, English, Persian, Spanish, etc.

**Aliyah Plans** (Weight: 5/10)
- Plans to move to Israel vs. staying in current country
- Major life decision that must align

### 5. **Lifestyle Compatibility**
**Relationship Traits** (Weight: 6/10)
- Communication, respect, trying new things, routine, etc.
- Shared values about what makes relationships work

**Conflict Resolution Style** (Weight: 5/10)
- Direct vs. calm vs. avoids confrontation
- How couples handle disagreements matters

**Activity Level** (Weight: 3/10)
- Very active vs. somewhat active vs. not active
- Shared lifestyle and energy levels

**Substance Habits** (Weight: 3-4/10)
- Alcohol and smoking preferences
- Lifestyle compatibility factors

## The Scoring System

### How Scores Are Calculated:
1. **Each factor gets a compatibility score** between 0-1:
   - **1.0** = Perfect match (same values)
   - **0.5** = Partial compatibility 
   - **0.0** = Incompatible

2. **Weighted Average**: Each factor is multiplied by its importance weight
   - Religious factors count more heavily
   - Basic compatibility factors are weighted less

3. **Final Score**: Converted to 0-100 scale
   - **90-100**: Exceptional compatibility
   - **80-89**: Very good match
   - **70-79**: Good potential
   - **60-69**: Worth considering
   - **Below 60**: Low compatibility

### Special Scoring Rules:

**Exact Matches**: When people have identical values (same Shabbat observance, same life goals), they get perfect scores for that factor.

**Similar Levels**: For ranked items (like religious observance), people at similar levels get high scores, with scores decreasing as the gap widens.

**Shared Interests**: For lists (languages, priorities), the algorithm calculates how much overlap exists.

## Real-World Example

**Sarah** (25, Orthodox, wants children, family-focused) and **David** (28, Orthodox, wants children, family-focused):

- **Religious Compatibility**: 95% (both Orthodox, similar observance)
- **Family Goals**: 100% (both want children, family-focused)
- **Cultural**: 80% (both Ashkenazi)
- **Lifestyle**: 85% (similar activity levels, non-smokers)
- **Overall Score**: 87% - Very Strong Match

- Identifies best overall matches in the system

## How Matchmakers Use This

1. **Client Consultation**: Algorithm provides initial screening of best prospects
2. **Match Explanation**: Detailed scores help explain why certain people are suggested  
3. **Prioritization**: Focus time on highest-scoring potential matches first
4. **Deal-breaker Identification**: Quickly rule out incompatible matches

## The Human Element

**Important**: The algorithm is a tool to assist matchmakers, not replace them. It:
- Provides data-driven starting points
- Highlights factors to discuss with clients
- Helps prioritize which introductions to make first
- Supports matchmaker intuition with objective analysis

The final decision always involves human judgment, personal chemistry, and factors the algorithm can't measure (like personality, sense of humor, and physical attraction).

## Success Metrics

We can track:
- How often high-scoring matches (80+) lead to dates
- Which compatibility factors predict successful relationships
- Whether algorithm suggestions align with matchmaker intuition
- Client satisfaction with recommended matches
